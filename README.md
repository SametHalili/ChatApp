# Webontwikkeling 4: ChatApp

This is a simple Java EE webapp using Servlets made as homework for school. This app allows you to create a new user, change his status, add other users to you friendlist and comment on hardcoded articles. 
The only part that needs to be done is the 1-on-1 chat between friends.

This app also has a second part which you can find [here](https://github.com/SametHalili/ChatAppAngular).
